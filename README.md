# SAR Processing

Repository for the processing pipline using _GDAL_ and _OpenCV_ libraries. Initially it was used for grayscale SAR processing, but it can be any other GDAL-supported raster format as input (e.g. _GeoTIFF_).

It is supposed to be used with _Google Colaboratory_ (_File -> Open notebook -> GitHub_).
