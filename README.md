# SAR Processing

Repository for ODS Summer of Code event with preprocessing and segmentation pipelines.

Preprocessing pipeline uses _GDAL_ and _OpenCV_ libraries. Segmentation pipeline uses _PyTorch_ and _Segmentation Models_ frameworks.

It is supposed to be used with _Google Colaboratory_ (_File -> Open notebook -> GitHub_).
